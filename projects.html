           Our project provided a broad overview of trends in US energy production by state and region from 2001-2019.
           With a focus on shifts from nonrenewable to renewable energy sources. We examined changes in fuel source, 
           megawatt hours by fuel source at the state level, and statistically significant changes in air pollution levels
           across the US, with projections for when we can expect to see a shift to 100% renewable energy production 
           at the current rate of change.
          </p>
          <p>
            After using API calls to retrieve the EPA data available at <a href="https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html">EPA.gov</a>, 
            we used Python to clean the data and build data frames. Next, we calculated quarterly percentages from 
            2001 to 2019 as we began to compare the changes between sectors. We also calculated the average predicted 
            growth using a linear regression model.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was an overall upward trend in renewable energy generation in the US from 2001-2019, 
            with renewable energy increasing at a rate of 1.02% per year. At this rate, the US will reach 100% 
            renewable energy by 2089. The forecasted renewable energy use for 2020 is 25.47% and 26.49% for 2021.

            The purpose of this project was to showcase our ability to extract, transform, and load data 
            otherwise known as ETL. We decided to choose the topic of video games and separated our data 
            into three segments. First, we used the livestreaming website, Twitch, and its developer tool 
            that allows us to perform API calls to pull in the top live games being played on its 
            <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/"> website </a>. Our next data source was from IGDB which is a video 
            game database that we used to webscrape the top games based on ratings and reviews by critics. 
            Our last data source was from a public dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> which 
            contains videogame sales and playtime information. We cleaned the data so that it could be useable 
            for any person interested in such information and loaded into a SQL databased using Postgres SQL.
